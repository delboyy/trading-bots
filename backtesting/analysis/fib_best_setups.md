## 💡 Recommendation
**Stick to the Breakout Strategy (ZigZag 2%).**
- It is the **only** strategy that has proven robust across multiple asset classes (Crypto, Stocks, Commodities).
- **Focus**: Volatility is the edge. Trade assets that move.
- **Avoid**: Trying to force mean reversion on trending assets.
